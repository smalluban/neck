# Neck

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smalluban/neck.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/smalluban/neck) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/smalluban/neck/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/smalluban/neck?branch=master)

Neck is a library that adds number of features to Backbone.js:

* Live data binding between view and controller
* HTML node attributes way to create logic in views
* Easy and automatic connection between controller and view
* Working with any template engine with data binding
* Two-way routing (by refrencing and url based) to nested views
* Simple dependeny injection module working with CommonJS out of the box

Neck is highly inspired (in convension and code) by frameworks 
[Angular](http://angularjs.org/) and [Batman](http://batmanjs.org/). 
If you already know one of them, it will be easy to you to start working with Neck.
